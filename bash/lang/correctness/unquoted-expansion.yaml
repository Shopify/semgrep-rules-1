  message: >-
    Variable expansions must be double-quoted so as to prevent
    being split into multiple pieces according to whitespace or
    whichever separator is specified by the IFS variable.
    If you really wish to split the variable's contents,
    you may use a variable that starts with an underscore e.g.
    $_X instead of $X, and semgrep will ignore it. If what you need
    is an array, consider using a proper bash array.

    # and won't match a simple variable expansion.
    # This is why we need two patterns below.
