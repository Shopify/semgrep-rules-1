  pattern: IFS=...
  message: >-
    The special variable IFS affects how splitting takes place when
    expanding unquoted variables. Don't set it globally.
    Prefer a dedicated utility such as 'cut' or 'awk' if you need to split
    input data. If you must use 'read', set IFS locally using e.g.
    'IFS="," read -a my_array'.
